# Hi there, I'm Haochen Ma (马浩宸) 👋

I am an experienced Materials and Semiconductor Packaging Engineer with a Master's degree in Materials Science from **Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学)**. My career has provided me with end-to-end experience, from fundamental materials analysis (SEM, TEM) to leading R&D in advanced packaging technologies like 2.5D TSV.

My passion lies in solving complex, multi-disciplinary engineering challenges at the intersection of materials, process, and device performance. I am now eager to apply my industrial expertise to academic research.
