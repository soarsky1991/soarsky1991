# Hi there, I'm Haochen Ma (马浩宸) 👋

I am an experienced Materials and Semiconductor Packaging Engineer with a Master's degree in Materials Science from **Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学)**. My career has provided me with end-to-end experience, from fundamental materials analysis (SEM, TEM) to leading R&D in advanced packaging technologies like 2.5D TSV.

My passion lies in solving complex, multi-disciplinary engineering challenges at the intersection of materials, process, and device performance. I am now eager to apply my industrial expertise to academic research.

### 🎯 Research Interests & PhD Goal

I am actively seeking a PhD position in Germany to research **high-density, low-loss advanced packaging technologies for co-packaged optics (CPO) and silicon photonics**. My interests include:

*   Photonics-Electronics Co-Packaging (e.g., CPO)
*   3D/2.5D Integration & Through-Silicon Via (TSV) Technology
*   Thermal Management and Signal Integrity for High-Speed Optical Modules
*   Novel Materials and Processes for Optoelectronic Packaging
